# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not using a** Random Forest model**. We will analyze a hotel booking dataset to understand patterns and factors influencing booking cancellations.

## Skills/Concepts Developed

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model building using Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search
- Evaluation metrics for classification
- Feature importance visualization

## Problem Statement

Have you ever wondered how many hotel bookings are canceled or what is the peak time for the hotel? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore these questions! We aim to build a Random Forest model to predict whether a hotel booking is canceled or not.

## Modeling

### Steps

1. Read the hotel dataset.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including data quality checks and treatment of missing values.
3. Analyze the categorical data and transform it using One-Hot Encoder or Label Encoder.
4. Analyze the numerical data and transform it using Power Transform.
5. Scale the data.
6. Split the data into a train and test set.
7. Apply the Random Forest Model.
8. Tune the hyperparameters using Grid Search.
9. Evaluate the model using performance metrics.
10. Visualize the feature importances.

## Visualization

We will visualize the feature importances of the Random Forest model to understand the factors influencing hotel booking cancellations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we successfully built a Random Forest model to predict hotel booking cancellations. The model achieved high accuracy and ROC AUC score, indicating its effectiveness in predicting cancellations.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we can provide recommendations to hotel management to optimize booking management and reduce cancellations.

## How to Use

To use this model, simply follow the steps outlined in the code and adjust parameters as needed for your specific dataset.
